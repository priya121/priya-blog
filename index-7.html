        <div data-id="content"><p>It is amazing how much of a difference keeping a calm and focused mind can make when you write code and try and solve a problem. Taking a break always helps, but doing yoga today reminded me of earlier this year when I did 20 days of yoga in a row and was never in better shape. I had more energy, more focus and was much more calm.</p><p>This is something that I also get from running which has an energizing effect on me. I am sure that I am happier, healthier and have more energy when I eat well and work out. So I am going to keep this up and see if this has a tangible effect on the code that I write.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Java Input Output streams abstract different ways in which you can input and output data. The stream can be sent to or taken from any source, it does not matter. It is really a stream or flow of bytes from one destination to another.</p><p>Java divides streams into bytes or character based categories. The character unit of a character based stream is a Unicode or ASCII character and transfers input and output of 8-bit bytes at a time.</p><p>This is in contrast to FileReader and FileWriter, which even though they internally use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream, read and write two bytes at a time. This can slow down your program and so it can be an advantage to use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream directly to transfer the data across sources.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>As my minesweeper program is getting bigger and I am starting to think about the different classes that could emerge from the existing ones it already has, it is becoming increasingly important to think about <em>how</em> they should be separated. </p><p>I am currently reading Kent Beck’s Implementation Patterns and he describes the various categories of class separation and state. There are a lot of categories, and I think the only way to really fully understand their use is to actually use them in my code.</p><p>The ones I have come across already are Interfaces, and Superclasses to some extent. He also talks about specialization and the types of questions you should be asking if you want to think about how to separate out classes. Some patterns I have not really used yet are the Implementor pattern and the Inner Class.</p><p>Most of the state based patterns are concerned with how an object changes state. This is primarily done through the internals of the object, so all the methods it contains.</p><p>I am going to try and notice when I use these patterns in my code and write up how I am trying to use them.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing clean code definitley becomes easier as you get better at writing code and your knowledge of what is possible grows. But making sure you write cleanly as you go is more about discipline. I have to reduce all the methods in my Minesweeper down to three methods which is quite tricky and is getting trickier as I am putting it off. I think it would actually have been better to start with small methods, refactoring at every possible stage and keep everything cleanly separated. So going forward, I am definitely going to start by keeping my methods short and saving myself the pain of refactoring so that I keep my code as clean as possible from the start.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I was getting comfortable with deciding which objects should be separate in Ruby and starting to sense what they should and should not be doing. This was probably because I had built a few games and was starting to see the pattern of what should be separated out. </p><p>It is strange that when the syntax for something is new, even though the objects it represents might not be so different from another language, it feels different to think about how these objects should be separated out. Hopefully, with a bit of practice this will again start to become clear and the more I write, the easier it will become.</p></div>
