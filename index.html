        <div data-id="content"><p>Java Input Output streams abstract different ways in which you can input and output data. The stream can be sent to or taken from any source, it does not matter. It is really a stream or flow of bytes from one destination to another.</p><p>Java divides streams into bytes or character based categories. The character unit of a character based stream is a Unicode or ASCII character and transfers input and output of 8-bit bytes at a time. </p><p>This is in contrast to FileReader and FileWriter, which even though they internally use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream, read and write two bytes at a time. This can slow down your program and so it can be an advantage to use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream directly to transfer the data across sources.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Testing a randomised output can be difficult, as if an actual random number is returned, the result will be different every time. In order to tackle this I have used interfaces that swap in for certain tests and then also allow for simulated input to be tested. </p><p>In Java the simplest way to test input and output is to use a ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream. These can then be easily swapped out for System.in and System.out when used in the main method and the program is run.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well they can be useful.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I was getting comfortable with deciding which objects should be separate in Ruby and starting to sense what they should and should not be doing. This was probably because I had built a few games and was starting to see the pattern of what should be separated out. </p><p>It is strange that when the syntax for something is new, even though the objects it represents might not be so different from another language, it feels different to think about how these objects should be separated out. Hopefully, with a bit of practice this will again start to become clear and the more I write, the easier it will become.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have been so focused on learning TDD and trying my best to stick to it I never really considered there were other ways of testing. BDD is the topic ofa Clean Coders video I watched this week and it was interesting to think of the need for business to be able to write specifications that programmers can write in. </p><p>Like so many industries it is the differences in terminology that really leads to miscommunication, so finding words that are understood by all is important. Of course terminology is there for a reason, it is always more concise and saves time. But for something to be useful outside of an industry, it is important to at least be able to communicate something simply. I think that is why Einstein said: If you cannot explain it simply enough, you do not understand it well enough. </p><p>It is similar to the idea that a problem must be broken down into its most basic components in order for any computation. If you want a person who is not in your industry, or a programmer you need to be able to break the words down into simple non-technical words for them to be able to understand, and this is only achievable through practice. </p></div>
