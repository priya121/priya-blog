      <div data-id="content"><p>The main class in java must be present in the application at least once for it to be able to run and has a pretty standard signature.</p><p>Methods in java have to have certain elements in order for the Java package to be able to collect the parts of the program together and process them in a logical way.</p><p>Firstly a method must be public or private. Public means that it is available across packages whereas private means it is only accessible within the current package. Then if a method is static(that is, it is not called by Objects within the class) this must also be part of the method signature.</p><p>These are followed by what the method signature will return (String, Integer, String[], void etc.) and the method name.</p><p>In Java if a method takes an arguement, the type of arguement must also be declared within parentheses, this is true even if the method takes no arguement with the parentheses being left blank.</p><p>Method signatures in Java seem complicated at first, but I have been told that this makes things clearer in the long term, so far most of my programs and tasks have been small, but I will report back when I know if this is true.</p></div>
