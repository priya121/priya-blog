        <div data-id="content"><p>Stacks are a pretty fundamental concept in CS. They represent how data is allocated to memory at a basic level. A stack area on computer memory is of a fixed origin and variable size. The two basic operations that are used most frequently on a stack are inserting an item and removing an item. A stack uses the concept of last in first out (LIFO) as opposed to a queue which uses the concept of (FIFO). In Java it is possible to create a stack and call certain predefined methods on it like push, pop, peek, search and size. Like most Java lists a stack has to contain matching objects within it that must be declared when it is first created.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Starting a program or application from scratch can be daunting, but it is also exciting. What helps clarify the direction of where you need to start is a series of stories. The first few stories are important as they can help guide the rest of the application. </p><p>It is important to start with the most degenerate case and then test the code from there. That is why it is not always useful to have too much planned out for the later stages of the code as it is quite likely that it will change. </p><p>I have started on some stories for a minesweeper game and the most degenerate case for that is the return of an exploded mine (that I will represent as a 1) when the relevant index (depicted by a coordinate) will change.</p><p>I have the next few stories written down and the later they get the more abstarct they become. But this is a useful exercise that I hope I will get better at, because most of the time, once you have figured out how to do something, actually doing it and putting it into code is much easier.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The main class in java must be present in the application at least once for it to be able to run and has a pretty standard signature.</p><p>Methods in java have to have certain elements in order for the Java package to be able to collect the parts of the program together and process them in a logical way.</p><p>Firstly a method must be public or private. Public means that it is available across packages whereas private means it is only accessible within the current package. Then if a method is static(that is, it is not called by Objects within the class) this must also be part of the method signature.</p><p>These are followed by what the method signature will return (String, Integer, String[], void etc.) and the method name.</p><p>In Java if a method takes an arguement, the type of arguement must also be declared within parentheses, this is true even if the method takes no arguement with the parentheses being left blank.</p><p>Method signatures in Java seem complicated at first, but I have been told that this makes things clearer in the long term, so far most of my programs and tasks have been small, but I will report back when I know if this is true.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Why Java functions the way it does becomes clearer once the way the Java memory model is understood. I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface but here is a little of what I have learnt so far.</p><p>The memory model dictates how the virtual memory model interacts with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The Java memory model splits memory used by a Java application between thread stacks and the heap. Which of these is used depends on the type defined. Primitive types are stored on the thread stacks and objects or references to those objects are stored on the heap stack.</p><p>If there are multiple variables representing primitive types, these can be stored as separate items on different thread stacks as copies of the original type.</p><p>Using primitive types increases the speed of an application despite the fact that creating Objects references can be easier to use, so I am going to try and use primitive types when it makes sense to do so.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Difference between an Array List and Array in Java</p><p>In Java Arrays and ArrayLists are differentiated in some important aspects:</p><ol><li><p>An Array is fixed in length, whereas the ArrayList can be added to and is dynamic in size.</p></li><li><p>ArrayLists cannot contain primitive data types whereas an Array can contain both Object references and primitive types.</p></li><li><p>.iterator can be used to iterate through an ArrayList, whereas a for or while loop can be used to iterate through an Array.</p></li><li><p>The length of an ArrayList is provided by the .size() method whereas .length is needed to determine the length of an array.</p></li><li><p>Elements can be added to an ArrayList using .add() and must be inserted using assignment for an Array.</p></li><li><p>An array can be multi-dimensional, but ArrayLists must always be one dimensional.</p></li></ol><p>This is another example of how careful consideration must be given to setting a type before it is declared in Java.
