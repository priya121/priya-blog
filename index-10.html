        <div data-id="content"><p>When I started to write a Battleship game earlier this year, I started with how I imagine I would build an actual game board if it was a physical object. Board does not really concern itself with the rules of the game and so even though this seems like a good place to start, it is better to first think about what the rules and operations of the game are and go from there.</p><p>It’s easy to approach most games/katas by thinking about a board or any of the physical parts of a task, as these seem like the obvious places to start building, but by doing it this way much more code needs to be written and it actually complicates a task. I am going to start thinking more operationally and hopefully this will force a better approach to writing more concise code.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Polymorphism is one of the greatest advantages of OOP (object oriented design). It basically means you can call different methods on an object and change its form.</p><p>This allows you to create many categories of an object. In Java all objects are polymorphic, because they are all part of the class Object.</p><p>A class can gave different underlying data, but can be presented in the same form as others due to polymorphism.</p><p>Polymorphism is a real advantage to OOP and even though I was not sure what the definition was, I have been using it a lot already.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have just started reading Software Craftsmanship, it helps to know a little of the history of something you try and practice everyday. I knew that software can be a craft and I understand the importance of it. Mainly after having learnt the hard way (through encountering problems doing the opposite). </p><p>So what does a craft entail exactly? It is the combination of art and utility. That means it not only has to function well, but also look aesthetically beautiful. The history of why software design is described as engineering is discussed in the first chapters of the book and I highly recommend it, it is a fascinating read. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have heard about design patterns and their uses, how they are just tools that you can use to possibly improve your code. That they have their uses, but also their limitations.</p><p>But I think it is important to be aware of them at the very least and then decide whether or not you want to or should use them.</p><p>The first one I have come across at the classroom sessions we have daily is the Decorator Pattern that handles common instances by wrapping them within one another. </p><p>This is done in Java through the use of interfaces which I have implemented in my Guess the Number game. </p><p>This allows for the addition of new instances with slight variations that do not impact the original instance and so many different variations can be created easily and this makes extra requirements cleaner and easier to implement.</p><p>I think this was a good design pattern to start with, and something I can use in the code I am writing. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>When I first heard about code retreats I thought a holiday or trip was involved at some point. I suppose that was the original idea, that people would go and meet each other at a specific location and code together.</p><p>I took part in my first code retreat today and it was really fun! The retrospectives about what has been learnt is particularly interesting, but the part I enjoyed was working with people and seeing how they approach the specific problem, especially when it is so different to mine.</p><p>I saw how some people communicate through narration, others let code do the talking and others ask questions. I was even exposed to a new language and had to be quiet for a full 20 minutes when trying to complete a specific task with my pair, which was a struggle.</p><p>We had 20 minute iterations, or pairing sessions with a specific constraint and this made the challenges difficult, but it was a great way to get some exposure to a code retreat in a short space of time.</p><p>I am looking forward to my next one!</p></div>
