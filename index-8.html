        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing clean code definitley becomes easier as you get better at writing code and your knowledge of what is possible grows. But making sure you write cleanly as you go is more about discipline. I have to reduce all the methods in my Minesweeper down to three methods which is quite tricky and is getting trickier as I am putting it off. I think it would actually have been better to start with small methods, refactoring at every possible stage and keep everything cleanly separated. So going forward, I am definitely going to start by keeping my methods short and saving myself the pain of refactoring so that I keep my code as clean as possible from the start.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I was getting comfortable with deciding which objects should be separate in Ruby and starting to sense what they should and should not be doing. This was probably because I had built a few games and was starting to see the pattern of what should be separated out. </p><p>It is strange that when the syntax for something is new, even though the objects it represents might not be so different from another language, it feels different to think about how these objects should be separated out. Hopefully, with a bit of practice this will again start to become clear and the more I write, the easier it will become.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Recursion is one of the most useful things I learnt when I first began how to code. </p><p>Recursion is simply when a method or function calls itself with changing data being assessed.</p><p>It is a good example of how a simple algorithm can handle complexity by analyzing data. It is similar to a loop, but instead of being given a finite termination condition or number of times to execute, it is able to assess itself when the condition has been met and this can be an extremely powerful tool.</p><p>It is best to see how recursion works by looking at a simple algorithm. I have found that this is actually the best way to learn most new concepts. Applying them one at a time to a simple problem helps as there is less to distract you from the actual use of the tool. I remember the first time I tried to apply it was with a prime factors kata and it was also well explained with a Towers of Hanoi kata. I usually use a while loop, but I am going to try and remember to use recursion if it makes more sense or makes my code easier to read.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Testing a randomised output can be difficult, as if an actual random number is returned, the result will be different every time. In order to tackle this I have used interfaces that swap in for certain tests and then also allow for simulated input to be tested. </p><p>In Java the simplest way to test input and output is to use a ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream. These can then be easily swapped out for System.in and System.out when used in the main method and the program is run.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well they can be useful.</p></div>
