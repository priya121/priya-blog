        <div data-id="content"><p>Recursion is one of the most useful things I learnt when I first began how to code. </p><p>Recursion is simply when a method or function calls itself with changing data being assessed.</p><p>It is a good example of how a simple algorithm can handle complexity by analyzing data. It is similar to a loop, but instead of being given a finite termination condition or number of times to execute, it is able to assess itself when the condition has been met and this can be an extremely powerful tool.</p><p>It is best to see how recursion works by looking at a simple algorithm. I have found that this is actually the best way to learn most new concepts. Applying them one at a time to a simple problem helps as there is less to distract you from the actual use of the tool. I remember the first time I tried to apply it was with a prime factors kata and it was also well explained with a Towers of Hanoi kata. I usually use a while loop, but I am going to try and remember to use recursion if it makes more sense or makes my code easier to read.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Testing a randomised output can be difficult, as if an actual random number is returned, the result will be different every time. In order to tackle this I have used interfaces that swap in for certain tests and then also allow for simulated input to be tested. </p><p>In Java the simplest way to test input and output is to use a ByteArrayInputStream and ByteArrayOutputStream. These can then be easily swapped out for System.in and System.out when used in the main method and the program is run.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Enums in Java allow for a specific data type to be set as a list of predefined constants. Most of the time, these predefined constants represent constants in the real world, like days of the week or months in a year. These rarely change so can be set for the duration of a program and do not represent numeric values or textual data.</p><p>Enums in Java are type safe, meaning that they cannot be reassigned to another type once they have been set. It is also possible to set values for the enums and retrieve these by calling .values() on them.</p><p>They can be used somewhat recklessly when defining a type on a set of values, but used well they can be useful.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have been so focused on learning TDD and trying my best to stick to it I never really considered there were other ways of testing. BDD is the topic ofa Clean Coders video I watched this week and it was interesting to think of the need for business to be able to write specifications that programmers can write in. </p><p>Like so many industries it is the differences in terminology that really leads to miscommunication, so finding words that are understood by all is important. Of course terminology is there for a reason, it is always more concise and saves time. But for something to be useful outside of an industry, it is important to at least be able to communicate something simply. I think that is why Einstein said: If you cannot explain it simply enough, you do not understand it well enough. </p><p>It is similar to the idea that a problem must be broken down into its most basic components in order for any computation. If you want a person who is not in your industry, or a programmer you need to be able to break the words down into simple non-technical words for them to be able to understand, and this is only achievable through practice. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>So last time I wrote about Git Pull requests, I more or less covered the basics and had not really made any practical requests. I had just made one basic one without any messages or meaningful pieces of code. Something the other apprentices and I are trying to do more of is reviewing each others code and so I tried making some pull requests today. I created multiple branches and somehow managed to delete my master branch when trying to use git with Intellij, but I finally managed to make a pull request with a little piece of code and functionality that could be read easily by someone. </p><p>I am still making some formatting and whitespace errors that I am still working on, but I think I am getting the hang of it. I am going to try and use pull requests and make them as frequently as possible now, so I can maybe get some feedback as I go and not fall into bad habits.</p></div>
