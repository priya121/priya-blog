        <div data-id="content"><p>Creating a git pull request allows a developer to ask others to review their code when a new feature has been added, a change has been made or they want other developers to review their code for any other reason. </p><p>In order to do this the following steps are necessary:</p><p>If you want to work on an exisiting project, a fork of the exisiting project repository needs to be made. Once this is done a copy of the project will have been made.</p><p>Then a clone of the forked repository must be made, this will create a new working copy of the project on a local machine.</p><p>Before creating a new feature, a new branch for the feature has to be created and any changes must be added and commited to this branch.</p><p>Once these changes have been made it is possible to push these to the copy of the repository, (not the main repository) by a git push. </p><p>After this has been done, a pull request can be made through the relevant copied repository page. </p><p>Creating pull requests is useful when working in a team and it encourages collaboration. I am going to try and make one pull request a day.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Static methods in Java are used when the method needs to be called without creating an object of the class.</p><p>An instance variable needs an object to be created for it to be called whereas a static method does not. That is why most main classes in Java must be static.</p><p>Static methods typically take all their data from their parameters and create something from those parameters. They also typically have no reference to variables.</p><p>It is possible to make many methods static, but this is bad practice as it is unclear as to what the responsibility of the class is when many methods can be called on it that are not necssarily related to what it does. A static method called on a class is also not polymorpic so this means that it is not possible to override the behavior set by a static method.</p><p>So it is important to think carefully when creating a static method and avoid using them unless necessary.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Mathematics is not vital to knowing how to program, but it definitely helps if you are good at it. This is formal logic. If x then y is not the same as if y then x (a mistake people make all the time in everyday conversation). Counting in binary is simple if you imagine that all a computer has access to is 0 and 1 or on and off in an electrical circuit.</p><p>Because of this, everything it reads has to be represented in 0s and 1s. So this means that once it has used 0 and 1 to represent a number it can repetitively reuse 0 and 1 to add onto the end of a previous combination of 0 and 1. </p><p>This is similar to the use of hexadecimal numbers. If you imagine that you can only count using the digits 0–10 and a–j once you have counted to 10 using the numbers in order to carry on 0a would represent 11 and 1a would be 21 etc. </p><p>In a similar way a computer uses 0s and 1s and combinations of these when it needs to add to a previous value.</p><p>The easiest way to calculate the binary value of a number is to divide a number by 2 and record the remainder value as part of the binary result until the number you are dividing is one.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Stacks are a pretty fundamental concept in CS. They represent how data is allocated to memory at a basic level. A stack area on computer memory is of a fixed origin and variable size. The two basic operations that are used most frequently on a stack are inserting an item and removing an item. A stack uses the concept of last in first out (LIFO) as opposed to a queue which uses the concept of (FIFO). In Java it is possible to create a stack and call certain predefined methods on it like push, pop, peek, search and size. Like most Java lists a stack has to contain matching objects within it that must be declared when it is first created.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Starting a program or application from scratch can be daunting, but it is also exciting. What helps clarify the direction of where you need to start is a series of stories. The first few stories are important as they can help guide the rest of the application. </p><p>It is important to start with the most degenerate case and then test the code from there. That is why it is not always useful to have too much planned out for the later stages of the code as it is quite likely that it will change. </p><p>I have started on some stories for a minesweeper game and the most degenerate case for that is the return of an exploded mine (that I will represent as a 1) when the relevant index (depicted by a coordinate) will change.</p><p>I have the next few stories written down and the later they get the more abstarct they become. But this is a useful exercise that I hope I will get better at, because most of the time, once you have figured out how to do something, actually doing it and putting it into code is much easier.</p></div>
