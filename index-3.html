        <section data-id="content"><p>Creating a git pull request allows a developer to ask others to review their code when a new feature has been added, a change has been made or they want other developers to review their code for any other reason. </p><p>In order to do this the following steps are necessary:</p><p>In order to work on an exisiting project, a fork of the exisiting project repository needs to be made. Once this is done a copy of the project will have been made.</p><p>Then a clone of the forked repository must be made, this will create a new working copy of the project on a local machine.</p><p>Before creating a new feature, a new branch for the feature has to be created and any changes must be added and commited to this branch.</p><p>Once these changes have been made it is possible to push these changes to the copy of the repository, (not the main repository) by a git push. </p><p>After this has been done, a pull request can be made through the relevant copied repository page. </p><p>Creating pull requests is useful when working in a team and it encourages collaboration.</p></section>

        <section data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby, even though there are a lot of restrictions on what you can and cannot do.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">10 September 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></section>

        <p data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">21 August 2015</p>
        <section data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language and it takes some getting used to when moving across from Ruby. This basically means that types have to be defined when you initially set them and cannot be changed at a later stage in an application or program. </p><p>This makes it more clear as to what is happening and provides more structure as less is hidden. The length of methods and simple statements are also therefore much longer than Ruby.</p><p>The Java koans are a good starting point and introduce basic Java tools (some used frequently and others not so much), but getting used to writing in a new language is the best way to learn it.</p></section>
