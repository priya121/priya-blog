        <div data-id="content"><p>Starting to learn Java, Intellij really is a great tool. I have just migrated to using vim and it is clear I was using Intellij for a lot of things I took for granted, alt + ENTER was definitely a go to command I used regularly. Despite occassionally being stuck in CAPS LOCK it allowed me to learn how to set up a java project very quickly.</p><p>Java is really verbose and Intellij imports a lot of dependencies and autocompletes a lot and this was really useful, but hid a lot of what was going on and what Java requires to run.</p><p>I am still exploring the benefits of learning how to write Java in pure vim and feel like I am learning a lot. I will report back after I get more comfortable with Java in vim and can properly weigh up the benefits and drawbacks, but if you are starting to learn Java for the first time, I can’t recommend Intellij enough.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The other day I helped a student apprentice with Ruby and it was strange going back to a dynamic language after focusing on Java for so long. Although it felt good not having the restrictions that Java has, I realised that it takes a little longer to understand what is going on if the names are not clear, and it is hard to keep track of what a variable represents as they can change back and forth so quickly. This is something that I should probably keep in mind when I go back to Ruby. Make the names incredibly clear and representative of what they are, or things can get confusing. I know I started with Ruby, but I think I might just prefer statically typed languages for now...</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>As Java documentation explains, a class is like a blueprint that can be used to create an object. Each time an object is created by calling new ObjectName an object constructed with the relevant constructors. </p><pre><code>Square square = new Square(50,50);

        <div data-id="content"><p>The Liskov Principle was formulated by Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing in 1994. It was described by them as:</p><p>Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.</p><p>This essentially means that subtypes of a an object may replace the object itself, without totally changing the functioning of a program.</p><p>In java this is ususally implemented with the use of abstract classes and interfaces. </p><p>The typical example for this is the square and the rectangle, which I think does not illustrate the example very well. A much better expalination was given by one of the craftsmen during a Zagaku this week. Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/8thlight/zagaku/blob/master/solid/lsp.md">Liskov</a>.</p></div>
