      <div data-id="content"><p>Recursion is one of the most useful things I learnt when I first began how to code. </p><p>Recursion is simply when a method or function calls itself with changing data being assessed.</p><p>It is a good example of how a simple algorithm can handle complexity by analyzing data. It is similar to a loop, but instead of being given a finite termination condition or number of times to execute, it is able to assess itself when the condition has been met and this can be an extremely powerful tool.</p><p>It is best to see how recursion works by looking at a simple algorithm. I have found that this is actually the best way to learn most new concepts. Applying them one at a time to a simple problem helps as there is less to distract you from the actual use of the tool. I remember the first time I tried to apply it was with a prime factors kata and it was also well explained with a Towers of Hanoi kata. I usually use a while loop, but I am going to try and remember to use recursion if it makes more sense or makes my code easier to read.</p></div>
