          <section data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></section>
