        <div data-id="content"><p>Java is a statically typed language, which means that every variable and every expression has a type that must be known at compile time.</p><p>Types limit the values a variable can hold or an expression can produce, but also help reduce errors in the long run.</p><p>So in Java, data is stored in the form of data types and every variable has a data type.</p><p>The data types in Java are split into two :-</p><p>primitive data types and object types/references</p><p>PRIMITIVE TYPES</p><p>The Java memory model specifies how the Java virtual machine works with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The value of a variable stored as a primitive type is typically stored in the memory location assigned to that variable on the thread stack</p><p>There are 8–predefined primitive by the language, here they are in order of increasing sizes and they are limited to those sizes:</p><p>“primitive” means a fundamental component that is used to create other, larger parts</p><p>When you create variable stored as a primitive type instead of creating an object on the heap, Java creates a kind of automatic variable that is not a reference. This variable holds the value directly and is placed on the stack making access more efficient.</p><p>int x = 3; &gt; this means at the memory location of x, 3 will be stored there</p><p>Primitive types also come in versions that are objects. Just capitalised and these have their own set of methods that can be called on them.</p><p>OBJECT TYPES</p><p>A variable of an object type is also called a reference. This is because the variable doesn’t contain the object, but contains a reference pointing to the object. These are stored in the heap.</p><p>The different object types in java are :</p><p>interface types, class types and array types</p><p>In order to create an object reference you must instantiate an object first so that you can manipulate it. So you don’t manipulate the object directly, but use a reference to the object. The reference to the object is like a remote control to the actual object the TV. So you can access the object by calling certain methods on the reference.</p><p>When you create an object in Java, it is stored on the heap. There is generally no limit to memory size in this area. To create an object on the heap, you would use the new keyword like this:-</p><p>eg. Integer myInteger = new Integer(45);</p><p>MEMORY MODEL</p><p>Primitive types and object types are stored within the Java Memory Model</p><p>A local variable (one not accessible by the class) may be of a primitive type, in which case it is kept on the thread stack.</p><p>A local variable may also be a reference to an object. In that case the reference (the local variable) is stored on the thread stack, but the object itself if stored on the heap.</p><p>An object may contain methods and these methods may contain local variables. These local variables are also stored on the thread stack.</p><p>The member variables of an object however, are stored on the heap along with the object itself. That is true both when the member variable is of a primitive type, and if it is a reference to an object. The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object.</p><p>AUTOBOXING</p><p>Before Java 5 you had to call a method on an object version of a primitive type in order to get the value</p><p>But with Java 5, Java automatically converts a primitive type like int into corresponding wrapper class object and unwraps an object if a primitive type is required</p><p>eg. ArrayList intList = new ArrayList(); intList.add(1); //autoboxing–primitive to object</p><p>int number = intList.get(0); // unboxing–object to primitive</p><p>Need to be careful, if you try to convert null to a primitive value you will get a NullPointerException</p><p>Integer myInteger = null; int myInt = myInteger;</p><p>Using operators and comparing values, and can also lead to unnecessary memory use.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I do not actively think about the memory that a program takes up when it runs. This is something that I am aware of, but my main concern is that the code works. I am starting to see that unnecessary calls lead to slow running programs and this is probably a factor that I should start considering. The simplest way to do this is to reduce the method calls a class makes if at all possible. In my minesweeper game I had 3 calls to get input from the user when this could have been saved as a single variable and reused. So this is something I will try and keep in mind as I start extracting out classes and trying to speed up the code that I am writing. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have tried to not extract classes out to early when writing a program, even when it is a very small program. However, I may fall into the trap of not extracting them out even when I need to. A sign that a class should be abstracted is that there is a variable being constructed in the class that should really only be a concern of a specific method. This is how the Single Responsibility Principle starts to apply and the question that need to be asked–what is this class doing? comes in handy. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I have done little of is looking at code written by other people. Yesterday I paired with another apprentice and looked at code written by someone else. This would have been quite difficult to do alone and was the first time I tried to understand some code written by someone else. It was good that I had someone who had done it before to guide me and we could look and discuss it together. I did make some mistakes with git and had to repeat a few things, but this actually made me learn the process a bit better. </p><p>Another learning point was to maybe look at the whole code/ class before we started to make changes as this would have made our lives easier in the long term (if we understood how the different methods interelated). I also saw that my naming was not very good, and that I should communicate what changes that I am making with clear messages. I suppose it was the first time I considered other people would be reading my git who were not completely aware of what I was working on. So I am going to try and redo my GuessTheNumber game in Java using frequent pull requests and commit to Git regularly. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Because Java is so statically typed, it is useful to know what the right data structure to use before using it. In Ruby I used Arrays for almost all lists that I was creating. In Java, my go to is an ArrayList, but recently I used a HashMap when trying to build a Histogram for a simple kata. Having restrictions on the data types you can use and what methods you can call on them is something I think will have more utility when I build larger programs. Something I probably should brush up on then is data structures and their uses. </p></div>
