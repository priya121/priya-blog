      <div data-id="content"><p>Memory is something that seems pretty abstract before you face a real problem with it. Objects and data are stored on the Java Virtual Machine and when writing simple small programs, when and how these are created is not that important.</p><p>It becomes more important when lots of different classes interact and the order objects are created and destroyed affects the efficiency of a program.</p><p>Java has two areas of memory. The stack and the heap.</p><p>The stack is where variables live and they live on the stack frame where the method they belong to is stored. Object reference variables also are stored in this way.</p><p>All objects however, live on the heap so that they can be destroyed by the garbage collector when they are no longer needed (when there are no longer any live references to them). If your program starts to run low on memory, the garbage collector destroys the objects that are no longer needed and memory will not run out.</p><p>I am working on a longer blog post about testing in Vim for Java using Gradle and even though I’m sure I’ve just scratched the surface, hopefully understanding memory management will make understanding how threads and sockets work more clear.</p></div>
