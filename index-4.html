        <div data-id="content"><p>Stacks are a pretty fundamental concept in CS. They represent how data is allocated to memory at a basic level. A stack area on computer memory is of a fixed origin and variable size. The two basic operations that are used most frequently on a stack are inserting an item and removing an item. A stack uses the concept of last in first out (LIFO) as opposed to a queue which uses the concept of (FIFO). In Java it is possible to create a stack and call certain predefined methods on it like push, pop, peek, search and size. Like most Java lists a stack has to contain matching objects within it that must be declared when it is first created.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The main class in java must be present in the application at least once for it to be able to run and has a pretty standard signature.</p><p>Methods in java have to have certain elements in order for the Java package to be able to collect the parts of the program togethr and process them in a logical way.</p><p>Firstly a method must be public or private. Public means that it is available across packages whereas private means it is only accessible within the current package. Then if a method is static(that is, it is not called by Objects within the class) this must also be part of the method signature.</p><p>These are followed by what the method signature will return (String, Integer, String[], void etc.) and the method name.</p><p>In Java if a method takes an arguement, the type of arguement must also be declared within parentheses, this is true even if the method takes no arguement with the parentheses being left blank.</p><p>Method signatures in Java seem complicated at first, but I have been told that this makes things clearer in the long term, so far most of my programs and tasks have been small, but I will report back when I know if this is true.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Why Java functions the way it does becomes clearer once the way the Java memory model is understood. I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface but here is a little of what I have learnt so far.</p><p>The memory model dictates how the virtual memory model interacts with the computer memory (RAM).</p><p>The Java memory model splits memory used by a Java application between thread stacks and the heap. Which of these is used depends on the type defined. Primitive types are stored on the thread stacks and objects or references to those objects are stored on the heap stack.</p><p>If there are multiple variables representing primitive types, these can be stored as separate items on different thread stacks as copies of the original type.</p><p>Using primitive types increases the speed of an application despite the fact that creating Objects references can be easier to use, so I am going to try and use primitive types when it makes sense to do so.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Interfaces are a set of classes that used to create an abstraction between two other related classes. They do not contain any new code but hold behaviours and method signatures and should be abstract classes with abstract names.</p><p>The advantage of using interfaces is that they help eliminate unnecessary dependencies that create rigid and fragile software. Adding interfaces hides the implementation of certain classes from others when they are not needed and allows for easier changes to the code later down the line.</p><p>Ruby and other dynamic languages do not need to have an explicit interface class, but it is necessary to define an interface class type explicitly for statically typed languages like Java.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>UML diagrams are commonly used when modelling for object oriented design programs. They are the graphical notation for drawing diagrams of software concepts.</p><p>Composite relationships are shown in a UML diagram by an arrow with one end a point and the other a diamond.</p><p>Inheritance is shown through a blank arrowhead and the arrows point in the direction that the inheritance flows from.</p><p>Class Icons are divided into three components, a class title, the variables and the functions and interfaces are shown by the &lt;&gt; notation.</p><p>It is always a good idea to draw up a UML before starting to write a program, and adjust it as you go.</p></div>
