I am really excited to see what the graduates have learnt and see if there is anything I can help with. I have to say, I am glad that I am not going alone and that other craftsmen and an apprentice will also be going.</p><p>Dealing with a client is something I am fairly familiar with from my previous legal training, but I am interested to see how different it is when you consult and train with code. I am also keen to see how much of 8th Light has rubbed off on the graduates and excited to see their final products and demos. I will write up how I found the day and what I learnt after the retrospective that day.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing code definitely becomes muscle memory the more you write and type. That is probably why going through a kata becomes so much easier the more you practice it. That is also why the best way to learn a new language is just to practice it and get a feel for what the best practices and style conventions for it are.</p><p>I suppose it is not groundbreaking that the more you practice something the easier it becomes. I have found this is especially true and measurable with exercise, which I definitely have fallen out of practice with.</p><p>Like committing to building something in order to ensure you learn a new language, I think I’ll sign up to a race in order to get back into the habit of exercise.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Starting to learn Java, Intellij really is a great tool. I have just migrated to using vim and it is clear I was using Intellij for a lot of things I took for granted, alt + ENTER was definitely a go to command I used regularly. Despite occassionally being stuck in CAPS LOCK it allowed me to learn how to set up a java project very quickly.</p><p>Java is really verbose and Intellij imports a lot of dependencies and autocompletes a lot and this was really useful, but hid a lot of what was going on and what Java requires to run.</p><p>I am still exploring the benefits of learning how to write Java in pure vim and feel like I am learning a lot. I will report back after I get more comfortable with Java in vim and can properly weigh up the benefits and drawbacks, but if you are starting to learn Java for the first time, I can’t recommend Intellij enough.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The other day I helped a student apprentice with Ruby and it was strange going back to a dynamic language after focusing on Java for so long. Although it felt good not having the restrictions that Java has, I realised that it takes a little longer to understand what is going on if the names are not clear, and it is hard to keep track of what a variable represents as they can change back and forth so quickly. This is something that I should probably keep in mind when I go back to Ruby. Make the names incredibly clear and representative of what they are, or things can get confusing. I know I started with Ruby, but I think I might just prefer statically typed languages for now...</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Constructing tests and deciding where to start is difficult, especially at the very beginning. A useful place to start is the most basic use case, an empty array or string representing the final construction you want to start building. This is a good entry point and from there you can start building out what you want to construct step by step, closer to the final product.</p><p>A good practice, that is difficult to adpot, is to think about what your code would ideally look like on execution and write a test that reflects this. This is of course more difficult than you would imagine. Most of the time, even before a test has been written you have some idea of how you want to di this in code. I think it is a good idea to try and detach and try on just focus on the tests and go from there. This is something I know I definitely need to work on.</p></div>
