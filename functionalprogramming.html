      <div data-id="content"><p>I thought I knew what functional programming was but I was wrong! I suppose I need to take one step at a time and I am sure during my apprenticeship I will eventually come to learn a functional language, but there is no harm in knowing the basics. So I thought I would share what I came across.</p><p>A functional language is a language that avoid mutating or changing data, so you would just create new data structures instead of changing ones that already exist. This really helps break a problem down into its component parts.</p><p>Functional programs are also required to be stateless, that is, they should perform every task as if they were performing it for the first time. This is a pretty different way of thinking and I have just got my head around object oriented (OO) programming so am glad I will tackle functional programming once I have a bit more practice at writing OO languages.</p></div>
