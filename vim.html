      <div data-id="content"><p>When I first started to learn Ruby, I started with Vim, an advanced text editor that was difficult to navigate at first. My mentor sent me the Vim Adventures game, which is an easy introduction into learning how to navigate using Vim. It was <em>really slow</em> to begin with and I always reverted to using my arrow keys, so these were disabled to force me to use shortcuts. It was annoying and slow at first, but after a while I was noticably faster at writing code.</p><p>When I started to learn Java however, I moved on to the beautiful Intellij which I really enjoyed using. I was able to get started pretty quickly and there are so many autocomplete suggestions and eror checkers in Intellij, it really helped me with my syntax and refactoring. But there is a lot that Intellij does for you that you can take for granted. This is why I think my next task was to use gradle to set up my Human vs Human Tic Tac Toe. Luckily one of the other Apprentices, Georgina, had used gradle before and talked me through her build file and style configurations that I cloned and used to get started.</p><p>Checkstyle and PMD really ensure that your code has the correct format and at times when one of them would pass the other would break, which is quite frustrating. There are a <em>lot</em> of syntax issues that I needed to work on with my Java and I definitely disabled some of the style check suggestions that were too stringent, but slowly I have stared to get used to running tests and setting up my Human vs Human tic tac toe with gradle.</p><p>There have been advantages and disagvantages to using vim and gradle for this iteration (instead of Intellij). I will write up a longer post on this topic after a little more research. So far there seems to be quite good reasons to use both, or at least know how to use both.</p></div>
