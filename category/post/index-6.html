        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I am working on is writing easier to read code. Previously I was so focused on getting my code to work as quickly as possible, I did not spend as much time as I should have naming as best as I could. </p><p>I am also working on separating out methods that only handle one piece of behaviour. Some of the other apprentices and I are going to start reviewing each others code and makimng pull requests so the readability of the code is going to be increasingly important.</p><p>Of all the various components of good clean code, naming is probably the most important so I am going to do my best to make mine as easy to read as possible.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>I was talking to someone at a workshop who used the comparison of TDD with a religion. The reason given for this was that there is no definitive study that shows code written using TDD is better than that not using it. So it is mainly faith that causes people to use TDD. Now I have researched this a little and I know it is not true. There are scientific studies that prove the benefits.</p><p>The idea of TDD is to write a test for some behaviour you expect, run the test to see it fail, write as little code as possible to see the test pass and then refactor if possible when the test is green. The next steps are to repeat this process until all the behaviour you want in your program has been tested effectively. </p><p>I feel the benefit of using TDD even in the small katas and programs that I am writing as I learn more. So I am going to keep using tests before I write, even though I have some way to go in learning which tests to start with. Hopefully this will come with practice. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I am still learning the optimal way to break a problem down. This is something I think I will gain a huge benefit from. I realised that there is a level of granularity that I am not used to. I need to not only know the steps of the general problem, but also the best way of breaking these down into methods and the best data structures for what I am trying to do.</p><p>I am going to slow down to speed up, and go back to pen and paper whenever I need to think about the best way to break a problem down.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I am still getting familiar with the SOLID principles and am trying to assess their value only when I see their value in bad code that I have written or problems that I come up against.</p><p>But I think reading through them at this stage is a good exercise. The Open Close Principle is the next one I am looking at, which states, that software entities should be closed for modification but open for extension.</p><p>That is, that it should be possible to make changes to the exisiting code and extend its behaviour without breaking the exisiting functionality of the code. Interfaces help with this as they allow you to extend the code more easily and help create compact classes that hold the required behaviour.</p><p>I am using this principle to a certain degree without realising it, but will try and be more concious of when I am using it and make sure I do so when required.</p></div>

          <p class="date" data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">04 October 2015</p>
        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>I am starting to really see the benefit of using fakes in my code. Working through a Guess the Number game and creating a fake that simulates the input and intermediate output is useful when writing tests because you need to be able to test behaviour that is not certain and can change each time a program is run.</p><p>The way this is done is through the use of an interface. An interface is essentially a class that contains the methods or behaviour that must be present for your class to work. The class that ultimately uses this behaviour is not aware of the behaviour of the object that implements the interface, provided that it contains the methods that the interface requires.</p><p>In the tests you can then create class that implements the methods or behaviour the interface requires, but set what they return to a value that is hardcoded. Then the actual console implementation can be passed in when the actual game is run so that the Fakes hardcoded returns can be replaced with a user input and the correct output.</p><p>Guess the number is a simple enough program to test this so this is a good way to start understanding IO and fakes in Java.</p></div>
