        <div data-id="content"><p>Creating a git pull request allows a developer to ask others to review their code when a new feature has been added, a change has been made or they want other developers to review their code for any other reason. </p><p>In order to do this the following steps are necessary:</p><p>If you want to work on an exisiting project, a fork of the exisiting project repository needs to be made. Once this is done a copy of the project will have been made.</p><p>Then a clone of the forked repository must be made, this will create a new working copy of the project on a local machine.</p><p>Before creating a new feature, a new branch for the feature has to be created and any changes must be added and commited to this branch.</p><p>Once these changes have been made it is possible to push these to the copy of the repository, (not the main repository) by a git push. </p><p>After this has been done, a pull request can be made through the relevant copied repository page. </p><p>Creating pull requests is useful when working in a team and it encourages collaboration. I am going to try and make one pull request a day.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>One of the things I am trying to get better at is writing concise code and a great way to do this is by reducing duplication. Initially I find that I write a lot of if statements, as these are the closest to real language that I use when describing the problem or visualizing it for the first time.</p><p>Sometimes this duplication is more subtle than I would like and an alorithm is hiding in there somewhere. It is more difficult to find once you have started to write, but again I think an old pen and paper helps. Sometimes, it takes a little time to find the pattern and additional tests can help to find the common patterns.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>While and Do While loops are two of the most common loops and they exist across most languages. A normal while loop executes the code inside it provided the boolean expression it evaluates is true.</p><p>It is easy to enter a never ending while loop accidently if you forget to include a terminating condition. So it is important to always consider if the condition that you want to exit the loop on is ever met. If it is not your program will never exit the loop or go past that point.</p><p>eg.</p><pre><code>while (true) 
    do (something)
 until (terminating condition)
</code></pre><p>A do while loop however, is that the code is always executed at least once, because the condition or expression is evaluated at the bottom of the loop. </p><p>This is an advantage in certain circumstances eg. if you need to make sure an output is printed at least once even if the condition within the while loop is not true.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>I am starting to really see the benefit of using fakes in my code. Working through a Guess the Number game and creating a fake that simulates the input and intermediate output is useful when writing tests because you need to be able to test behaviour that is not certain and can change each time a program is run.</p><p>The way this is done is through the use of an interface. An interface is essentially a class that contains the methods or behaviour that must be present for your class to work. The class that ultimately uses this behaviour is not aware of the behaviour of the object that implements the interface, provided that it contains the methods that the interface requires.</p><p>In the tests you can then create class that implements the methods or behaviour the interface requires, but set what they return to a value that is hardcoded. Then the actual console implementation can be passed in when the actual game is run so that the Fakes hardcoded returns can be replaced with a user input and the correct output.</p><p>Guess the number is a simple enough program to test this so this is a good way to start understanding IO and fakes in Java.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I am still getting familiar with the SOLID principles and am trying to assess their value. It is often only when I see them in bad code that I have written or problems that I come up against after not implementing them that I can spot them.</p><p>But I think reading through them at this stage is a good exercise. The Open Close Principle is the next one I am looking at, which states, that software entities should be closed for modification but open for extension.</p><p>That is, that it should be possible to make changes to the exisiting code and extend its behaviour without breaking the exisiting functionality of the code. Interfaces help with this as they allow you to extend the code more easily and help create compact classes that hold the required behaviour.</p><p>I am using this principle to a certain degree without realising it, but will try and be more concious of when I am using it and make sure I do so when required.</p></div>
