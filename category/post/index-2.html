I have not attempted too many katas so far, but intend to do as many as I can going forwards. Two that I have approached are the roman numerals kata and the coin changer kata. The more you practice them the easier they become.</p><p>I am going to attempt to at least start one every morning. <a href="http://exercism.io/">This</a> is a great website that has a long list of different katas in different languages and the well-known <a href="http://www.codewars.com/about">CodeWars</a> is another that is fun and easy to use.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Arrays in Ruby are incredibly useful and most of the tasks and programs that I built while I was learning Ruby had an array within them at some point or another. As I learn more Java I’m sure that arrays will be increasingly useful, (I have already used some briefly in some of the katas that I am practicing).</p><p>Arrays in Java must be created using an array creation expression. </p><p>e.g. new type[length] </p><p>The type must be explicitly set just like all data structures must be in Java. Similar to Ruby different elements can be accessed using array[i] where i is the index number of the element trying to be accessed.</p><p>It is also possible to create multi-dimensional arrays by writing type [] [], type [] [] [] etc.</p><p>There are also no array constants, new arrays are created every time an array initialiser is evaluated. </p><p>Despite there being these restrictions on arrays in Java, by using class Arrays in java.util certain utility methods are available that allow you manipulate the array.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Throwing an exception is a way of handling an error that a method may produce for a specific reason that was expected by the programmer who wrote it.</p><p>In Java, a complier will not let you compile a method if an exception is written that has not been handled or specifically declared.</p><p>Even though it is possible to declare that the main method throws the exception, it is always nicer to pass the declaration to another method and print a message to the user after another method has caught the exception. It is also good practice to tell the user how to address the error if at all possible.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Everything has to be explicitly declared in Java. I am starting to get used to it, even though the format looks different, the general structure of a class is not too different to Ruby. However, in Java there are a lot more restrictions on what you can and cannot do compared to a dynamic language.</p><p>In order to use Input Output in Java, the simplest way to do this is the InputStreamReader and OutputStreamReader.</p><p>The sytnax for these is System.in and System.out.print() respectively, but the format of these has to be changed accordingly when a certain type of display is needed.</p><p>It is also possible to use the Scanner class that parses primitive types and strings suing regular expressions.</p><p>There are so many tools and libraries that you can import in java that help you, it can be difficult to figure out which ones are best to use, but I am sure this is something that comes with practice and familiarity with the language. At the moment, I am avoiding using these until I get comfortable with what the standard Java Library contains.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>The single responsibility principle means that a class should only have one reason to change.</p><p>The idea is that each class should only have one role or handle one piece of behaviour. This does not mean that each class should contain one method, but if when describing a class behaviour, if the word ‘and’ is used, it is quite likely that the class is doing too much and the additional behaviour should be split out.</p><p>If the SRP is implemented well, then the design of the program will be more flexible and easier to change.</p><p>This is because if a class changes then only the class that handles that behaviour will have to change and the code will not be too coupled–meaning that one small change that must be made leads to numerous other things being forced to change.</p></div>
