        <div data-id="content"><p>I have just started reading Software Craftsmanship, it helps to know a little of the history of something you try and practice everyday. I knew that software can be a craft and I understand the importance of it. Mainly after having learnt the hard way (through encountering problems doing the opposite). </p><p>So what does a craft entail exactly? It is the combination of art and utility. That means it not only has to function well, but also look aesthetically beautiful. The history of why software design is described as engineering is discussed in the first chapters of the book and I highly recommend it, it is a fascinating read. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Polymorphism is one of the greatest advantages of OOP (object oriented design). It basically means you can call different methods on an object and change its form.</p><p>This allows you to create many categories of an object. In Java all objects are polymorphic, because they are all part of the class Object.</p><p>A class can gave different underlying data, but can be presented in the same form as others due to polymorphism.</p><p>Polymorphism is a real advantage to OOP and even though I was not sure what the definition was, I have been using it a lot already.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>When I started to write a Battleship game earlier this year, I started with how I imagine I would build an actual game board if it was a physical object. Board does not really concern itself with the rules of the game and so even though this seems like a good place to start, it is better to first think about what the rules and operations of the game are and go from there.</p><p>It’s easy to approach most games/katas by thinking about a board or any of the physical parts of a task, as these seem like the obvious places to start building, but by doing it this way much more code needs to be written and it actually complicates a task. I am going to start thinking more operationally and hopefully this will force a better approach to writing more concise code.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Because Java is so statically typed, it is useful to know what the right data structure to use before using it. In Ruby I used Arrays for almost all lists that I was creating. In Java, my go to is an ArrayList, but recently I used a HashMap when trying to build a Histogram for a simple kata. Having restrictions on the data types you can use and what methods you can call on them is something I think will have more utility when I build larger programs. Something I probably should brush up on then is data structures and their uses. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Something I have done little of is looking at code written by other people. Yesterday I paired with another apprentice and looked at code written by someone else. This would have been quite difficult to do alone and was the first time I tried to understand some code written by someone else. It was good that I had someone who had done it before to guide me and we could look and discuss it together. I did make some mistakes with git and had to repeat a few things, but this actually made me learn the process a bit better. </p><p>Another learning point was to maybe look at the whole code/ class before we started to make changes as this would have made our lives easier in the long term (if we understood how the different methods interelated). I also saw that my naming was not very good, and that I should communicate what changes that I am making with clear messages. I suppose it was the first time I considered other people would be reading my git who were not completely aware of what I was working on. So I am going to try and redo my GuessTheNumber game in Java using frequent pull requests and commit to Git regularly. </p></div>
