        <div data-id="content"><p>Sorting algorithms incredibly useful and underlie so many of the algorithms that we use for analysing complex data. Some are more efficient than others and all of them use the concept of nodes. A node is a way to represent a section of the data you would like to analyse. This node is compared with other nodes and its relative position is then decided. </p><p>The efficiency of sorting algorithms is determined by the O(log)n logarithm. This is more a measure of time, and has variations that explain how and how quickly an algorithm can perform its operations. I am due to perfrom a kata next week, so I will write up a detailed post on one of these sorting algorithms next week. </p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I sometimes have a hard time communicating what I have done or want to do in code into simple easy to understand language. Something that I think helps most people is the use of an analogy. This allows people to assimilate the information within the context of something they understand. </p><p>This is assuming there is an appropriate analogy, which sometimes there is not. If you cannot explain it simply enough, you do not understand it well enough. This is why pair programming really helps, it can help solidify knowledge you already had and help you identify areas you need more clarity on. The other apprentices and I have been pretty good at pairing regularly and I think carrying on with this will definitely be useful in getting better at communicating out intentions in code.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>I have always listened to music while I work. I always found it fun and eaiser to concentrate when I hd my headphones in and music on. I even remember holding a math statistics experiment (probably in an attempt to liten to more music whie I studied) that measured if I was more productive while working and listening to music. Now this probably was not the most scientific experiment and I am sure the results were skewed. But I found I was more productive when I listened to music. Of course the only way that I anyone can completely focus is in silence. There are times when I need this, but most of the time if I have some music on I find I can tune out my surroundings and focus.</p><p>I am going to try and spend some time listening to music and coding and spend some other dedicated time trying to code without music and see in which setting I am more productive. I suppose that eventually, there will be times when listening to music to focus is necessary and other times when I should try and refrain and not plug in.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>The Liskov Principle was formulated by Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing in 1994. It was described by them as:</p><p>Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.</p><p>This essentially means that subtypes of a an object may replace the object itself, without totally changing the functioning of a program.</p><p>In java this is ususally implemented with the use of abstract classes and interfaces. </p><p>The typical example for this is the square and the rectangle, which I think does not illustrate the example very well. A much better expalination was given by one of the craftsmen during a Zagaku this week. Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/8thlight/zagaku/blob/master/solid/lsp.md">Liskov</a>.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>As Java documentation explains, a class is like a blueprint that can be used to create an object. Each time an object is created by calling new ObjectName an object constructed with the relevant constructors. </p><pre>

<p>A class can have multiple constructors, and it is possible to create variations of an object by using these different constructors (if the constructors are different they must have different signatures. A constructor has the same name as the class and has no return type.</p><pre>
