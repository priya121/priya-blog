        <div data-id="content"><p>Today all the Apprentices and Craftsmen of the 8th Light London office attended a Leadership workshop and spent a few hours discussing what values we hold dear and which ones we would like to improve upon.</p><p>There was quite a bit of introspection involved, which was good. Sometimes when you are so busy it is difficult to find the time to pause and reflect. I usually use the time I run and exercise to do this, but I have fallen out of practice with it and am not running as regularly as I used to. So it was nice to have time dedicated to think about what I would like to personally aim for.</p><p>Something that came up for me quite frequently was quality, but really if you looked carefully at most of the results that came up frequently there was quite some room for interpretation. Quality to me can be applied to most areas of life. To me quality just means putting time and care into something, that leads to better results naturally. This can mean quality time with friends and family, quality in cooking a meal, quality in building a house, quality in a performance. It is again the aggregation of marginal gains and doing things with purpose. I am quite an excitable person, which definitely has its time and place but I would like to sometimes slow down and pay even more attention to detail which I am sure will help my work.</p><p>So this is what I personally got out of the workshop, I am going to take time to pause and reflect more and strive for quality and consideration in everything (well most things anyway!) that I do.</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>It really is amazing how humans can empathize with each other and even some other animals to an extent.</p><p>Like anything though, empathy is something that comes with practise. There is an element of imagination involved. JK Rowling, captures it well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHGqp8lz36c">this</a> commencement speech she gave.</p><p>Empathy not only makes communicating with other people much easier, it allows you to learn so much more than you would otherwise. This is something that is especially handy when you are in a learning environment, and even when people say things you do not agree with. Most of the time, they do not intentionally mean to be malicious, they are just drawing on the sum of their experiences. That is not to say sometimes it can still be annoying! But it is easier to handle if you know <em>why</em> they think this way.</p><p>I know I was fortunate to meet a variety of people being born and living abroad for some time, having parents of a different culture and attending an international school, but it is easy, especially in a city like London, to meet people from a huge range of places.</p><p>Travel, must be one of the best ways to meet people from a background different to yours nand develop empathy. This of course is not the only way to develop empathy. Some people who have never travelled can be more empathetic than the most avid traveller, but if you are open-minded, meeting people whose upbringings and views are different to yours can only add to your knowledge and make your life much more interesting. I mean imagine a world where everyone was the same, what a beige and boring place to be.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>One of the rules in Corey Haines’s book Four Rules of Simple Design is to express intent and one of the first ways he proposes to adhere to this rule is to have good names within your code.</p><p>This is easier said than done. I tend to have longer more descriptive names that will at least allow me to remember what they represent. But this often clutters up my code and I sometimes do not come back to change it. So it probably makes sense to spend that extra time thinking of a good representative name that anyone reading the code will be able to decipher.</p><p>This is as true of tests as it is of actual code. Tests should also be clear in their intent. Like everything in code, (much like everything in life!) it is all about trade offs, sometimes a more verbose name is neccessary, but can take up space, other times it is better to have concise names that do not capture the whole explanation of what the name represents. It is always good however, to take that little bit of extra time and think of the best name you can at that moment.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Git is actually quite an amazing tool. I am aware I use it to a fraction of its capacity, but even the idea that so much code is open for anyone to see is inspired.</p><p>I recently helped organize an open source workshop to encourage others to learn how to collaborate with others and create pull requests. It was called @24pullrequests and the idea behind @24pullrequests is that everyday in December leading up to Christmas you submit a pull request on an open source project that has some issues.</p><p>There was even a table of new Java developers who could not find a project to contribute to so I helped them create a pull request for my Minesweeper game! I hope I can create more pull requests and get other people to contribute to my issues. I suppose the first step to this however would be to have small and regular commits so that anyone who actually wants to find certain functionality won’t have to wade through my code so they can help. So this a reminder to myself and others, make regular commits and make pull requests!</p></div>

        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Recursion can be a tricky concept and I know I definitely struggled with it when I first started learning how to code. But it is simply a method calling itself with changing parameters that causes it to recurse. This can often be accomplished by a while loop which actually creates fewer stack frames, but can be a less elegant way of tackling a simple problem.</p><p>So the main driving factor as far as I can see is the clarity of your code and the length of your program (including how much data it needs to analyze and compute).</p><p>This is a great <a href="http://roman01la.github.io/recursion-exercises/">webiste</a> that has a lot of great mini examples and ways to practice recursion.</p></div>
