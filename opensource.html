      <div data-id="content"><p>Git is actually quite an amazing tool. I am aware I use it to a fraction of its capacity, but even the idea that so much code is open for anyone to see is inspired.</p><p>I recently helped organize an open source workshop to encourage others to learn how to collaborate with others and create pull requests. It was called @24pullrequests and the idea behind @24pullrequests is that everyday in December leading up to Christmas you submit a pull request on an open source project that has some issues.</p><p>There was even a table of new Java developers who could not find a project to contribute to so I helped them create a pull request for my Minesweeper game! I hope I can create more pull requests and get other people to contribute to my issues. I suppose the first step to this however would be to have small and regular commits so that anyone who actually wants to find certain functionality won’t have to wade through my code so they can help. So this a reminder to myself and others, make regular commits and make pull requests!</p></div>
