      <div data-id="content"><p>Starting a program or application from scratch can be daunting, but it is also exciting. What helps clarify the direction of where you need to start is a series of stories. The first few stories are important as they can help guide the rest of the application. </p><p>It is important to start with the most degenerate case and then test the code from there. That is why it is not always useful to have too much planned out for the later stages of the code as it is quite likely that it will change. </p><p>I have started on some stories for a minesweeper game and the most degenerate case for that is the return of an exploded mine (that I will represent as a 1) when the relevant index (depicted by a coordinate) will change.</p><p>I have the next few stories written down and the later they get the more abstarct they become. But this is a useful exercise that I hope I will get better at, because most of the time, once you have figured out how to do something, actually doing it and putting it into code is much easier.</p></div>
