        <div data-id="content"><p>Today Micah, the founder of 8th Light held his second day of the mastery cohort and all of us were kindly given an Arduino starter kit. I had wanted one for a while and it felt like an early Christmas present. </p><p>Arduino is a company that designs, manufactures and sells micro-contollers and micro-controller accessories. These allow you to connect to your computer and program various circuits and components. It was interesting to read through the introductory book that came with the starter kit and it reminded me of my GCSE Physics classes. </p><p>The first exercise was to build a simple series circuit and write up code that would cause a LED bulb to light up. We then connected a paralell circuit and made flashing lights that were supposed to look like a spaceship. It was cool to see how simple code would cause the electrical components to do what we wanted them to do. Well, most of the time anyway!</p><p>After lunch we attempted a Love Machine exercise that used a thermometer component to tell how “hot” you were, and also managed to get the keyboard exercise working with 3 simple musical notes. </p><p>It was a great introduction to how software connects to simple hardware and I am excited to try some more of the exercises out in my own time. One I have my eye on is the Crystal Ball, which looks more complex as there are many more connections that must align with specific parts of the digital display. Hopefully, I’ll manage to get it working and will be able to build on it once I do.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Today during Micah’s mastery cohort we had to make several GET requests to a local host and work on a game in which ants had to gather food from a grid of an infinite size. A coordinate of a nest is given from which ants can be spawned, (only 5 initially). Then if an ant goes to a coordinate with food, these have been randomly placed, it should go back to the nest and then another ant can be spawned, in addition to the original 5.</p><p>This was the second time over the past month in which the apprentices had the chance to look at how HTTP requests are sent and it is starting to make more sense.</p><p>Here is the code we used for the GET request:</p><pre>

public class AntSparring {

            con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0");
            con.setRequestProperty("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
            BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));

            String line;
            while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {
                result.append(line);

            rd.close();
            String finalResult = result.toString();
            return finalResult;

<p>In hindsight, Java may not have been the best language to do this challenge in, but I learnt a lot and I definitely would like to go back and try and finish off the program.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>It always amazes me how many analogies to life can come from running a marathon. One of them is definitely to find your own pace and stick to it. It is easy to get carried away at the beginning of the race, especially when there are others around you hurtling past, but staying focused on your own pace and knowing what your limits are is really important to being able to finish.</p><p>In the opposite sense, with Christmas round the corner and everything seemingly slowing down up to Christmas and New Year, it is easy to slow down along with everyone, but I still feel like I have a lot to do. So I am going to do stick to my pace and carry on learning through the holiday season, even when it is easy to feel like nobody is really working on anything! Of course I’ll be sure to enjoy the occasional mince pie and take time to see family and friends, but I’ll do my best to keep up my focus and pace the rest of the time.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>A lot of the building of a Java project is hidden when you are using Intellij. In order to get a project running from the command line it is necessary to use a build tool and Maven is one of these tools. It can build projects in Ruby, Scala and C# but is mainly used to build Java.</p><p>When a language is built, this simply means to compile the program into an executable format (taking the source files and compiling them into object files.) A compiler takes the source code written in a language and converts it into another computer language (often binary).</p><p>Maven works by using an XML file that describes the project and all the dependencies, build order and plug-ins.</p><p>Maven projects are configured using a POM or Project Object Model and these are stored in a pom.xml fie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model">Here</a> is the wikipedia example.</p><p>When you write a Maven project the structure you need is:</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Maven_CoC.svg/150px-Maven_CoC.svg.png" alt="Smaller icon" /></p><p>By running the command: mvn package all the java files are compiled, all tests run and it packages all deliverable code and resources into target/my-app-1.0.jar.</p><p>The command I used to run my maven project (MineSweeper) was: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=”com.example.Main” in which com.example are packages you may have introduced in your class structure.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>When I first started to learn Ruby, I started with Vim, an advanced text editor that was difficult to navigate at first. My mentor sent me the Vim Adventures game, which is an easy introduction into learning how to navigate using Vim. It was <em>really slow</em> to begin with and I always reverted to using my arrow keys, so these were disabled to force me to use shortcuts. It was annoying and slow at first, but after a while I was noticably faster at writing code.</p><p>When I started to learn Java however, I moved on to the beautiful Intellij which I really enjoyed using. I was able to get started pretty quickly and there are so many autocomplete suggestions and eror checkers in Intellij, it really helped me with my syntax and refactoring. But there is a lot that Intellij does for you that you can take for granted. This is why I think my next task was to use gradle to set up my Human vs Human Tic Tac Toe. Luckily one of the other Apprentices, Georgina, had used gradle before and talked me through her build file and style configurations that I cloned and used to get started.</p><p>Checkstyle and PMD really ensure that your code has the correct format and at times when one of them would pass the other would break, which is quite frustrating. There are a <em>lot</em> of syntax issues that I needed to work on with my Java and I definitely disabled some of the style check suggestions that were too stringent, but slowly I have stared to get used to running tests and setting up my Human vs Human tic tac toe with gradle.</p><p>There have been advantages and disagvantages to using vim and gradle for this iteration (instead of Intellij). I will write up a longer post on this topic after a little more research. So far there seems to be quite good reasons to use both, or at least know how to use both.</p></div>
