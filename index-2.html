        <div data-id="content"><p>One of the rules in Corey Haines’s book Four Rules of Simple Design is to express intent and one of the first ways he proposes to adhere to this rule is to have good names within your code.</p><p>This is easier said than done. I tend to have longer more descriptive names that will at least allow me to remember what they represent. But this often clutters up my code and I sometimes do not come back to change it. So it probably makes sense to spend that extra time thinking of a good representative name that anyone reading the code will be able to decipher.</p><p>This is as true of tests as it is of actual code. Tests should also be clear in their intent. Like everything in code, (much like everything in life!) it is all about trade offs, sometimes a more verbose name is neccessary, but can take up space, other times it is better to have concise names that do not capture the whole explanation of what the name represents. It is always good however, to take that little bit of extra time and think of the best name you can at that moment.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>It really is amazing how humans can empathize with each other and even some other animals to an extent.</p><p>Like anything though, empathy is something that comes with practise. There is an element of imagination involved. JK Rowling, captures it well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHGqp8lz36c">this</a> commencement speech she gave.</p><p>Empathy not only makes communicating with other people much easier, it allows you to learn so much more than you would otherwise. This is something that is especially handy when you are in a learning environment, and even when people say things you do not agree with. Most of the time, they do not intentionally mean to be malicious, they are just drawing on the sum of their experiences. That is not to say sometimes it can still be annoying! But it is easier to handle if you know <em>why</em> they think this way.</p><p>I know I was fortunate to meet a variety of people being born and living abroad for some time, having parents of a different culture and attending an international school, but it is easy, especially in a city like London, to meet people from a huge range of places.</p><p>Travel, must be one of the best ways to meet people from a background different to yours nand develop empathy. This of course is not the only way to develop empathy. Some people who have never travelled can be more empathetic than the most avid traveller, but if you are open-minded, meeting people whose upbringings and views are different to yours can only add to your knowledge and make your life much more interesting. I mean imagine a world where everyone was the same, what a beige and boring place to be.</p></div>

        <p class="date" data-id="published-at" data-format="dd MMMM yyyy">02 December 2015</p>
        </header>
        <div data-id="content"><p>Today all the Apprentices and Craftsmen of the 8th Light London office attended a Leadership workshop and spent a few hours discussing what values we hold dear and which ones we would like to improve upon.</p><p>There was quite a bit of introspection involved, which was good. Sometimes when you are so busy it is difficult to find the time to pause and reflect. I usually use the time I run and exercise to do this, but I have fallen out of practice with it and am not running as regularly as I used to. So it was nice to have time dedicated to think about what I would like to personally aim for.</p><p>Something that came up for me quite frequently was quality, but really if you looked carefully at most of the results that came up frequently there was quite some room for interpretation. Quality to me can be applied to most areas of life. To me quality just means putting time and care into something, that leads to better results naturally. This can mean quality time with friends and family, quality in cooking a meal, quality in building a house, quality in a performance. It is again the aggregation of marginal gains and doing things with purpose. I am quite an excitable person, which definitely has its time and place but I would like to sometimes slow down and pay even more attention to detail which I am sure will help my work.</p><p>So this is what I personally got out of the workshop, I am going to take time to pause and reflect more and strive for quality and consideration in everything (well most things anyway!) that I do.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Next week I will be going along to visit a client site and see the final projects of their graduate intake. I am really excited to see what the graduates have learnt and see if there is anything I can help with. I have to say, I am glad that I am not going alone and that other craftsmen and an apprentice will also be going.</p><p>Dealing with a client is something I am fairly familiar with from my previous legal training, but I am interested to see how different it is when you consult and train with code. I am also keen to see how much of 8th Light has rubbed off on the graduates and excited to see their final products and demos. I will write up how I found the day and what I learnt after the retrospective that day.</p></div>

        <div data-id="content"><p>Writing code definitely becomes muscle memory the more you write and type. That is probably why going through a kata becomes so much easier the more you practice it. That is also why the best way to learn a new language is just to practice it and get a feel for what the best practices and style conventions for it are.</p><p>I suppose it is not groundbreaking that the more you practice something the easier it becomes. I have found this is especially true and measurable with exercise, which I definitely have fallen out of practice with.</p><p>Like committing to building something in order to ensure you learn a new language, I think I’ll sign up to a race in order to get back into the habit of exercise.</p></div>
